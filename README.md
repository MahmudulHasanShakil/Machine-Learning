# Machine-Learning
The rapid growth of information technology and
the disruptive transformation of social media have
happened in recent years. Websites like Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram, where people can express their
thoughts or feelings by posting text, photos or
videos, have become incredibly popular. But it has
also a bad reputatin for spreading toxicity. There
are many existing works in this field but those are
not fully successful yet to provide accuracy in satisfactory level. I employ natural
language processing (NLP) and convolution neural
network (CNN).
